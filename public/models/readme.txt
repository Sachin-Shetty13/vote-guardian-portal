This directory contains face-api.js models for face detection and recognition.

In a production environment, you would download and place the following model files here:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-shard2

For this demo, we're using mock face detection.
